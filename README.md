# VRCCameraDollyPaths
A collection of basic animation paths for use with the VRChat Camera Dolly.

How to Use:
* Download JSON file, copy its file path
* Tweak duration/speed, zoom, height (Position Y) and other values as desired
  * As is, this collection assumes default height of about 1.7m
  * If you're wanting to use an animation with an avatar that is smaller or taller, you'll need to update each point's Position Y value accordingly
* In VRChat, open the camera, navigate to Dolly, and under Advanced, click Import
* Paste the file path and click Submit
